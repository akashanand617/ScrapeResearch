Viral structural proteins have the capacity to function both in assembly and in disassembly, which is made possible through a built-in flexibility triggered by cellular events. We observe conformational changes of viral particles at various states of their life cycle to analyze their assembly intermediates as well as the mature forms. Similarly, infectious virions can be treated with numerous conditions, e.g. receptor-mediated genome release or acid-activated membrane fusion, to observe the key steps of viral re-entry into host cells. Using electron microscopy, we apply a rapid-frozen and low-dose imaging procedure to best preserve the biological specimen in its native form. Computer image processing is developed to retrieve most of the useful signal from the low-contrast micrographs. Technical implementation of cryo-EM, cellular tomography, and computational modeling schemes also enables us to address interactions involved in complex biological molecules and/or nanoscale machines."

International perspectives are no mere theoretical work obligation to him, as he speaks five languages, worked in four continents, and has traveled to over 70 countries.\nHe chairs UCD's DE in Computational Social Science (\nhttps://css.ucdavis.edu\n) and is co-founder of UCD's Computational Communication Research Lab (\nhttp://c2.ucdavis.edu\n).\nResearch Focus\nProfessor Hilbert is interested in both the theory and practice of digitalization. In search for a deeper theoretical understanding of the workings of the digital age, he uses the formal mathematical tools of information theory to develop a coherent intellectual framework for analyzing information societies. At the same time, his research monitors and analyzes the practical implications of the incessant evolution of the digital age, including questions of social inequality (aka 'digital divide'), the use of digital trace data to monitor development (aka 'big data'), and the effects of digitalization on the scientific method ('computational social science').\nHe has written several books about digital technology for international development and published in recognized academic journals, including Science, Psychological Bulletin, World Development, Complexity, JASIST, Telecommunications Policy, and Technological Forecasting and Social Change. His research findings have been featured in Scientific American, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, The Economist, NPR, BBC, Die Welt, Correio Braziliense, La Repubblica and El Pais, among others.\nView his complete list of publications\n.\nTeaching\nProfessor Hilbert walks the talk of digitalization by employing a carefully selected mix of online and offline educational tools for his course offerings. Innovative digital methods for education allow for unprecedented possibilities in terms of interdisciplinary collaboration, fostering of diversity, mass-customization for tailored student needs, and international reach. Professor Hilbert teaches undergraduate online courses on \"\nDigital Technology and Social Change\n\" (CMN 170V) and \"\nComputational Social Science\n\" (CMN 150V), as well as a\nMOOC on Complex Systems in Spanish\n, and diverse graduate-level courses on information theory (aka the 'mathematical theory of communication')."
